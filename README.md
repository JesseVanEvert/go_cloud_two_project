# go_cloud_two_project


*Notes: 
The use of different branches and repositories, by some of the team members, has caused the insights on the contribution page to become wacky.
For example: it looks like Mahedi rewrote the code for the Apollo 11 mission :rocket: and Brandon and Tanzeel went along for the ride.
Jesse has only used master, and the insights concerning his commits are accurate.*

*To give a more accurate depiction a header with everyone's contributions has been added to this README.*

*The architecture design can be found in the wiki, or in the master branch -> documents.*
